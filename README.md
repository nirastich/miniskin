# MiniSkin Generator

MiniSkin Generator is a simple yet fun tool that merges two Minecraft skins to create a new skin where the second skin carries a mini-version of the first skin on its head.

## Features

- **Dual Input Options:** Input skins either by username (utilizing the mineskin.eu API) or by directly uploading an image.
- **Skin Preview:** Uses the vzge.me API to generate a preview of the new skin.
- **Flexibility:** Supports both 64x64 and 64x32 skin dimensions, including slim skins.
- **Layer Control:** Options to show or hide the second layer of the upper and lower body parts to ensure the best look.
